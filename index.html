	<h3>Welcome to Overwatch League: Legacy. We are here to commemorate the
	legacy of the Overwatch League. The Overwatch League was a professional 
	esports league for Blizzard Entertainment's team-based multiplayer game 
	Overwatch that ran from 2018 to 2023. The Overwatch League consisted of 
	20 franchised teams representing cities from around the world.</h3>
	
	<h3>The Overwatch league offered prize money for top-performing teams, and 
	individual players can earn accolades such as MVP (Most Valuable Player) 
	and Rookie of the Year based on their performance throughout the season.
	The Overwatch League featured highly skilled players who compete at the 
	highest level of the game. Teams often have coaches, analysts, and support
	staff to help them prepare for matches and improve their performance.</h3>
	
	<h3>We will take a look at each team that competed in the Overwatch League
	and their achievements. There will also be a mock schedule used for 
	entertainment purposes. Matches are won when a team reaches 3 map wins.</h3>
